# Azure-telemetry-service
The purpose of the project entitled as “Azure IoT Hub” titled as “Azure Telemetry Service” is to focus on Microsoft Azure’s component, i.e., Azure IoT Hub. It’s one of the unique features of Azure Cloud which helps us to connect with other devices or microcontrollers (Raspberry) from a VMac or Virtual Machine. This whole project is based on IoT Hub Integration. In this Project we opened an Azure account and inside the portal we created an IoT Hub. Then we registered the external device which is to be connected and last send a telemetry message to the device from the machine to check if it is working or not. Python is also been used here for typing up the main source code which is needed for installing the device and checking up the messages send later. After all the resources are cleaned so that no further cost are being cut for that as Azure charges for every data sent and received.

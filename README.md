Abstract


The purpose of the project entitled as “Azure IoT Hub” titled as “Azure Telemetry Service” is to focus on Microsoft Azure’s component, i.e., Azure IoT Hub. It’s one of the unique features of Azure Cloud which helps us to connect with other devices or microcontrollers (Raspberry) from a VMac or Virtual Machine. This whole project is based on IoT Hub Integration. In this Project we opened an Azure account and inside the portal we created an IoT Hub. Then we registered the external device which is to be connected and last send a telemetry message to the device from the machine to check if it is working or not. Python is also been used here for typing up the main source code which is needed for installing the device and checking up the messages send later. After all the resources are cleaned so that no further cost are being cut for that as Azure charges for every data sent and received.
















What is Azure IoT Hub?

 

IoT Hub is a managed service, hosted in the cloud, that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

IoT Hub supports communications both from the device to the cloud and from the cloud to the device. IoT Hub supports multiple messaging patterns such as device-to-cloud telemetry, file upload from devices, and request-reply methods to control your devices from the cloud. IoT Hub monitoring helps you maintain the health of your solution by tracking events such as device creation, device failures, and device connections.

IoT Hub's capabilities help you build scalable, full-featured IoT solutions such as managing industrial equipment used in manufacturing, tracking valuable assets in healthcare, and monitoring office building usage.

 

Scale your solution

IoT Hub scales to millions of simultaneously connected devices and millions of events per second to support your IoT workloads. IoT Hub offers several tiers of service to best fit your scalability needs. Learn more by checking out the pricing page.

Secure your communications

IoT Hub gives you a secure communication channel for your devices to send data.

Per-device authentication enables each device to connect securely to IoT Hub and for each device to be managed securely.

You have complete control over device access and can control connections at the per-device level.

The IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service automatically provisions devices to the right IoT hub when the device first boots up.

Multiple authentication types support a variety of device capabilities:

SAS token-based authentication to quickly get started with your IoT solution.

Individual X.509 certificate authentication for secure, standards-based authentication.

X.509 CA authentication for simple, standards-based enrollment.

 

Route device data

Built-in message routing functionality gives you flexibility to set up automatic rules-based message fan-out:

Use message routing to control where your hub sends device telemetry.

There is no additional cost to route messages to multiple endpoints.

No-code routing rules take the place of custom message dispatcher code.

Integrate with other services

You can integrate IoT Hub with other Azure services to build complete, end-to-end solutions. For example, use:

Azure Event Grid to enable your business to react quickly to critical events in a reliable, scalable, and secure manner.

Azure Logic Apps to automate business processes.

Azure Machine Learning to add machine learning and AI models to your solution.

Azure Stream Analytics to run real-time analytic computations on the data streaming from your devices.

Configure and control your devices

You can manage your devices connected to IoT Hub with an array of built-in functionality.

Store, synchronize, and query device metadata and state information for all your devices.

Set device state either per-device or based on common characteristics of devices.

Automatically respond to a device-reported state change with message routing integration.

Make your solution highly available

There's a 99.9% Service Level Agreement for IoT Hub. The full Azure SLA explains the guaranteed availability of Azure as a whole.

Connect your devices

Use the Azure IoT device SDK libraries to build applications that run on your devices and interact with IoT Hub. Supported platforms include multiple Linux distributions, Windows, and real-time operating systems. Supported languages include:

C

C#

Java

Python

Node.js.

IoT Hub and the device SDKs support the following protocols for connecting devices:

HTTPS

AMQP

AMQP over WebSockets

MQTT

MQTT over WebSockets

If your solution cannot use the device libraries, devices can use the MQTT v3.1.1, HTTPS 1.1, or AMQP 1.0 protocols to connect natively to your hub.

If your solution cannot use one of the supported protocols, you can extend IoT Hub to support custom protocols:

Use Azure IoT Edge to create a field gateway to perform protocol translation on the edge.

Customize the Azure IoT protocol gateway to perform protocol translation in the cloud.

Quotas and limits

Each Azure subscription has default quota limits in place to prevent service abuse, and these limits could impact the scope of your IoT solution. The current limit on a per-subscription basis is 50 IoT hubs per subscription. You can request quota increases by contacting support. For more details on quota limits:

Sending telemetry from a device to an IoT hub and read it with a back-end application using Python

Python

IoT Hub is an Azure service that enables you to ingest high volumes of telemetry from your IoT devices into the cloud for storage or processing. In this quickstart, you send telemetry from a simulated device application, through IoT Hub, to a back-end application for processing.

The quickstart uses a pre-written Python application to send the telemetry and a CLI utility to read the telemetry from the hub. Before you run these two applications, you create an IoT hub and register a device with the hub.

 

Open Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive shell environment hosted in Azure and used through your browser. Azure Cloud Shell allows you to use either bash or PowerShell shells to run a variety of tools to work with Azure services. Azure Cloud Shell comes pre-installed with the commands to allow you to run the content of this article without having to install anything on your local environment.

To run any code contained in this article on Azure Cloud Shell, open a Cloud Shell session, use the Copy button on a code block to copy the code, and paste it into the Cloud Shell session with Ctrl+Shift+V on Windows and Linux, or Cmd+Shift+V on macOS. Pasted text is not automatically executed, so press Enter to run code.

You can launch Azure Cloud Shell with:

Option

Example/Link

Select Try It in the upper-right corner of a code block. This doesn't automatically copy text to Cloud Shell.

Open Azure Cloud Shell in your browser.

Select the Cloud Shell button on the menu in the upper-right corner of the Azure portal.

 

 

Prerequisites

The sample application you run in this quickstart is written using Python. Currently, the Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs for Python support only specific versions of Python for each platform. To learn more, see the Python SDK Readme.

This quickstart assumes you are using a Windows development machine. For Windows systems, only Python 3.6.x is supported. The Python installer you choose should be based on the architecture of the system that you are working with. If your system CPU architecture is 32 bit, then download the x86 installer; for the 64-bit architecture, download the x86-64 installer. Additionally, make sure the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 is installed for your architecture (x86 or x64).

You can download Python for other platforms from Python.org.

You can verify the current version of Python on your development machine using one of the following commands:


python --version


python3 --version

Run the following command to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI to your Cloud Shell instance. The IOT Extension adds IoT Hub, IoT Edge, and IoT Device Provisioning Service (DPS) specific commands to Azure CLI.

Azure CLI

az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext

Download the sample Python project from https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-iot-samples-python/archive/master.zip and extract the ZIP archive.

 

 

Create an IoT hub

This section describes how to create an IoT hub using the Azure portal.

Log in to the Azure portal.

Choose +Create a resource, then Search the Marketplace for the IoT Hub.

Select IoT Hub and click the Create button. You see the first screen for creating an IoT hub.

Fill in the fields.

Subscription: Select the subscription to use for your IoT hub.

Resource Group: You can create a new resource group or use an existing one. To create a new one, click Create new and fill in the name you want to use. To use an existing resource group, click Use existing and select the resource group from the dropdown list. For more information, see Manage Azure Resource Manager resource groups.

Region: This is the region in which you want your hub to be located. Select the location closest to you from the dropdown list.

IoT Hub Name: Put in the name for your IoT Hub. This name must be globally unique. If the name you enter is available, a green check mark appears.

 Important

Because the IoT hub will be publicly discoverable as a DNS endpoint, be sure to avoid entering any sensitive or personally identifiable information when you name it.

Click Next: Size and scale to continue creating your IoT hub.

On this screen, you can take the defaults and just click Review + create at the bottom.

Pricing and scale tier: You can choose from several tiers depending on how many features you want and how many messages you send through your solution per day. The free tier is intended for testing and evaluation. It allows 500 devices to be connected to the IoT hub and up to 8,000 messages per day. Each Azure subscription can create one IoT Hub in the free tier.

IoT Hub units: The number of messages allowed per unit per day depends on your hub's pricing tier. For example, if you want the IoT hub to support ingress of 700,000 messages, you choose two S1 tier units.

For details about the other tier options, see Choosing the right IoT Hub tier.

Advanced / Device-to-cloud partitions: This property relates the device-to-cloud messages to the number of simultaneous readers of the messages. Most IoT hubs only need four partitions.

Click Review + create to review your choices. You see something similar to this screen.

Click Create to create your new IoT hub. Creating the hub takes a few minutes.

 

 

Register a device

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before it can connect. In this quickstart, you use the Azure Cloud Shell to register a simulated device.

Run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to create the device identity.

YourIoTHubName: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

MyPythonDevice: This is the name given for the registered device. Use MyPythonDevice as shown. If you choose a different name for your device, you will also need to use that name throughout this article, and update the device name in the sample applications before you run them.

Azure CLI

az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyPythonDevice

Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to get the device connection string for the device you registered:

YourIoTHubName: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

Azure CLI

az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyPythonDevice --output table

Make a note of the device connection string, which looks like:

HostName={YourIoTHubName}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyNodeDevice;SharedAccessKey={YourSharedAccessKey}

You use this value later in the quickstart.

 

 

Send simulated telemetry

The simulated device application connects to a device-specific endpoint on your IoT hub and sends simulated temperature and humidity telemetry.

In a local terminal window, navigate to the root folder of the sample Python project. Then navigate to the iot-hub\Quickstarts\simulated-device folder.

Open the SimulatedDevice.py file in a text editor of your choice.

Replace the value of the CONNECTION_STRING variable with the device connection string you made a note of previously. Then save your changes to SimulatedDevice.py file.

In the local terminal window, run the following commands to install the required libraries for the simulated device application:

cmd/sh

pip install azure-iothub-device-client

In the local terminal window, run the following commands to run the simulated device application:

cmd/sh

python SimulatedDevice.py

The following screenshot shows the output as the simulated device application sends telemetry to your IoT hub:

To avoid the import iothub_client error

The current version of the Azure IoT SDK for Python is a wrapper over our C SDK. It is generated using the Boost library. Because of that, it comes with several significant limitations. See more details here

Check that you have the right version of Python. Be aware that only certain versions works fine for this sample.

Verify that you have installed the iothub client: pip install azure-iothub-device-client.

 

 

Read the telemetry from your hub

The IoT Hub CLI extension can connect to the service-side Events endpoint on your IoT Hub. The extension receives the device-to-cloud messages sent from your simulated device. An IoT Hub back-end application typically runs in the cloud to receive and process device-to-cloud messages.

Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell, replacing YourIoTHubName with the name of your IoT hub:

Azure CLI

az iot hub monitor-events --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyPythonDevice 

The following screenshot shows the output as the extension receives telemetry sent by the simulated device to the hub:

 

 

 

 

 

Clean up resources

If you will be continuing to the next recommended article, you can keep the resources you've already created and reuse them.

Otherwise, you can delete the Azure resources created in this article to avoid charges.

 Important

Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources contained in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the IoT Hub inside an existing resource group that contains resources you want to keep, only delete the IoT Hub resource itself instead of deleting the resource group.

To delete a resource group by name:

Sign in to the Azure portal and click Resource groups.

In the Filter by name... textbox, type the name of the resource group containing your IoT Hub.

To the right of your resource group in the result list, click ... then Delete resource group.

You will be asked to confirm the deletion of the resource group. Type the name of your resource group again to confirm, and then click Delete. After a few moments, the resource group and all of its contained resources are deleted.


 



















CONCLUSION


This project creates a Microsoft Azure account, with help of which we able to use Azure’s feature. It also focusses on creating IoT Hub. Then we have to connect the external device and send a telemetry message. The IoT Hub CLI extension can connect to the service-side Events endpoint on your IoT Hub. The extension receives the device-to-cloud messages sent from your simulated device. An IoT Hub back-end application typically runs in the cloud to receive and process device-to-cloud messages. We can delete the Azure resources created so to avoid extra charges.
